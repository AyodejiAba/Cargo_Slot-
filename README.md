Cargo Slot Efficiency Dashboard - Power BI Project
Overview
The Cargo Slot Efficiency Dashboard is designed to optimize cargo operations by analyzing the efficiency of slot utilization at cargo terminals. The dashboard tracks cargo throughput, slot occupancy rates, and operational performance to improve scheduling, reduce delays, and maximize terminal capacity. This tool helps logistics managers and operations teams make data-driven decisions to enhance cargo handling efficiency and minimize bottlenecks.

Key Features
Slot Utilization Rate: Tracks the percentage of available cargo slots used during different time periods.
Throughput Analysis: Measures the volume of cargo handled per slot and overall terminal efficiency.
Idle Time Analysis: Identifies periods when cargo slots are underutilized, allowing for scheduling adjustments.
Capacity Forecasting: Predicts future slot demand based on historical trends and seasonality.
Operational Performance by Shift: Analyzes slot efficiency during different shifts (e.g., day vs. night).
Data Sources
Slot Scheduling Data: Information about cargo slots reserved, used, and available during specific time frames.
Cargo Handling Data: Volume of cargo (weight, units) handled per slot.
Shift and Resource Data: Information about labor shifts, terminal resources, and equipment availability.
Calendar Data: A date table to support time-based slot analysis (hourly, daily, weekly).
Power BI Components
Dashboard: An interactive, real-time dashboard displaying key efficiency metrics and performance indicators.
Reports: Detailed reports on slot utilization, idle time, throughput, and shift performance.
Slot Utilization Heatmaps: Visual representations of slot usage by time period, highlighting peak and idle times.
Filters: Dynamic filters to adjust analysis by date range, cargo type, shift, and terminal zone.
Insights & Analysis
Slot Utilization: Analyze how efficiently cargo slots are used, identifying peak times and underutilized periods.
Throughput Efficiency: Track the volume of cargo handled per slot to determine operational efficiency.
Idle Time Analysis: Highlight periods where slots are reserved but not utilized, enabling optimization of scheduling.
Operational Shifts: Compare slot efficiency across different shifts and identify opportunities for improvement.
Capacity Forecasting: Use historical data to forecast future demand and allocate resources accordingly.
